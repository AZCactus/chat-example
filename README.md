# Cote - Socket.io Dead Simple Chat Example.

This is the source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Please refer to it to learn how to run this application.

You can run example in local,

```
npm install;
node index.js; # Which is sockend.
# In new terminal
node responder.js; # Which is responder and publisher
```

View => http://localhost:5555 !


Even you can try new instance,

```
node index.js 5556; # Create new instance for cote in 5556 port.
```


Also you can replicate your responder.

```
node responder.js # x7
```
